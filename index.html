	  				We are <span class="cs4all"> FCS4ALL</span>! Active since 2016, we are a computer science educational outreach program designed to prove that anyone and everyone can code.
	      		<br><br>
	      		<span class="cs4all">FCS4ALL</span> works with third to sixth graders in Baltimore City public schools to build coding intuition and demonstrate the power of even just a few lines of code. We teach computer science fundamentals through the lens of plant and food science by using the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/"> <span class="link">OpenAg Food Computer from MIT Media Lab. </span> </a>
	      		<br><br>
	      		After developing our original curriculum for the past year, we are happy to share it as a resource for teachers, after school programs, and community centers to learn from and implement themselves. 
	      		<br><br>
	      		As a supplement to the curriculum, we have also built a guide on constructing a low-cost <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/personal-food-computer/overview/"> <span class="link">Food Computer</span></a> that anyone can follow to build their very own personal and programmable greenhouse!

	  				A <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/personal-food-computer/overview/"> <span class="link">Food Computer</span></a> is a tabletop greenhouse that is controlled by a computer. Plants are grown hydroponically, meaning in water, and sensors are used to track conditions like climate and plant growth. Responding to the sensor information, the computer can adjust the environment to provide the ideal conditions for the specific plants in the Food Computer. Food Computers were developed as part of the ongoing <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/"><span class="link">Open Agriculture Initiative</span></a>, OpenAg, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, which is dedicated to developing sustainable food systems. <br> <br> We can use Food Computers to grow plants in their off-season or outside of their natural habitat, grow them faster and healthier, and grow them in special conditions that evoke specific gene expressions. The most exciting thing about a Food Computer is that anyone can build one and grow plants in their home and community!
        		<br> <br>
      			If you are interested in Food Computers but do not consider yourself a maker, have no fear! Instructions for building a Food Computer are open source by OpenAg but we know this can still be intimidating. As an additional resource, we have written a comprehensive guide based on our experience on building a low-cost Food Computer with limited resources. We have iterated through a couple Food Computer designs and implementations so learn from our mistakes!

      			<span class="cs4all">FCS4ALL</span>'s curriculum builds an introduction to plant science and expands to explore how technology can be used to grow plants in unfavorable environments. Students, ranging from third to fifth grade, build a basic understanding of computer science fundamentals through a tangible and concrete appliction. The Food Computer is utilized to explore the importance of computer programming, concepts of programming languages, and the basic principles of coding. Most of our curriculum does not require the use of a computer, and instead focuses on teaching through offline activities that incorporate both written and group activities. Our curriculum runs for eight weeks and can be used to fit a fifty to seventy minute time period.
        		<br> <br>
      			We are excited to share our curriculum with anyone who is interested in starting their own computer science program. We have published the entirety of our curriculum complete with instructions on how to teach each class, a list of all  the materials needed and preparation guides, and our tips for working with third through fifth grades. We have designed the curriculum so that anyone, even without a background in teaching, can pick it up and implement it in their community. We welcome anyone to replicate, edit, and expand parts or the entirety of our curriculum, and would love to hear about people’s suggestions as well as experiences.

      			Leila Kassiri and Olivia Capporizzo met each other while studying Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Neither of them had exposure to programming prior to college and saw an urgent need for universal computer science education. They founded <span class="cs4all">Food Computer / Computer Science 4 All</span> their sophomore year initially as an afterschool program but within the year, the program grew to teaching several daytime classes. In Baltimore City public schools, they have taught third through sixth graders at Barclay Elementary School, Gwynns Falls Elementary School, and Harford Heights Elementary School, reaching over 125 students. The initial funding for <span class="cs4all">FCS4ALL</span> came from Google’s igniteCS program with continued support from the Irini J Marlouis Award from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.
        		<br> <br>
      			We are very excited to share what we have learned over the past couple of years and hope we can support others in teaching the fundamentals of coding and building Food Computers. <a href="mailto:lkassir1@jhu.edu?cc=ocapori1@jhu.edu"><span class="link">Please feel free to reach out to us</span></a>, we especially love talking about computer science education, sustainable food production, and disco!</a></span>
